# toy-slam
A toy SLAM implementation for my learning purposes implemented in Python 3

## What it does so far:
- Obtains Keypoints
- Generates Matches between frames
- Cleans Matches
- Calculates a Fundamental Matrix
- Has some UI


## Todo:
- Add a camera calibration stage
- Calculate Rotation and Translation from Fundamental Matrix
- Add a Kalman Filter
- Do the 'M' part of SLAM (mapping)
